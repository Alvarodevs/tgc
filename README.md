## The Good Code test

### Back-end
Start with creating a node server with endpoints that provide CRUD for the front-end below.
You don’t need to connect a database, use the method familiar to you, to make it easy and
fast to implement.
If you want to impress us, nice to add :
- Type safety (either Flow or Typescript)
- Tests ( just one or two to show your ability of using them)


### Front-end
In front-end part, use the container / presentational component methodology to write
React components that will:
- Render an initial list of items to the page
- Implement controls to remove existing items
- Implement a means to set one of the items as ‘selected’
- Implement controls to add new items based on text input
Not obligatory, but nice to add:
- State management
- Tests
- Styling
